    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With two decades of professional experience spanning various sectors such as retail and food, I am a recent Cyber Security graduate poised to make a career transition into the field of cybersecurity. My diverse background has equipped me with a wide array of skills, including customer relationship management, operations oversight, team leadership, and business administration.

        In addition to my academic credentials, I am the proud founder of a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing cybersecurity awareness and education among both individuals and corporate entities. This initiative underscores my commitment to not just practicing cybersecurity, but fostering a broader understanding and appreciation for it in our increasingly digital world.
        
        After rigorous training and completion of a cybersecurity boot camp, I am eager to bring my multifaceted expertise and keen interest in cybersecurity to an organization where I can contribute to securing digital landscapes. I am currently exploring new opportunities in the cybersecurity realm, seeking a platform where I can integrate and utilize my extensive skills and newly acquired knowledge to the fullest extent.</p>
